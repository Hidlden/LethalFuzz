### Config changes [MI]

        FixPluginTypesSerialization/Config-File
                This config has been included within the LethalFuzz pack, due to previously being identified as a route cause to players being unable to host/join one another, or crashing. The dependency (itself) was still required by numerous required mods, but due to this reason, it was not being correctly implemented in this modpack. Not fully realising that the config, directory, and files within said DIR were required to be independently deployed within this modpack, for the "FixPluginTypesSerialization" modification/dependency to work, we have now released a patch to include these now.
        FixPluginTypesSerialization/Directory
                This ...LethalFuzz\BepInEx\patchers\ directory has been implemented in the pack due to being a requirement for the "FixPluginTypesSerialization" modification/dependency included as a dependency for other modifications within our modpack. Originally these were ignored, as they were either autogenerated, or included by other modifications, and just happened to have worked now and again....?? That is no longer the case, and upon facing connectivity issues, the config, directory, and files within said DIR have now included within this modpack to resolve these issues. 
        FixPluginTypesSerialization/Dir-Files
                Included within the ...\patchers\ directory are the following files; 'FixPluginTypesSerialization.dll', 'Microsoft.Deployment.Compression.Cab.dll', 'Microsoft.Deployment.Compression.dll'. Originally these were ignored, as they were either autogenerated, or included by other modifications, and just happened to have worked now and again....?? That is no longer the case, and upon facing connectivity issues, the config, directory, and files within said DIR have now included within this modpack to resolve these issues.

### Updated mods [PA]

        LethalLevelLoader
                LLL, has been patched to the latest version since the dev/testing 28.0.0 version has been pushed to the dev branch. Now fully up to date for the main/stable release of the pack.

# 28.0.0

<ul>
    <li> New gameplay mechanics, experiences, and overall changes to the configs. </li>
    <li> Additional moons included. </li>
    <li> Customised and fine-tuned moons, dungeons, item spawn percentage with the tie to said items for the theme of that moon/dungeon, monster percentages, and so much more tweaking.</li>
    <li> Expect things to be a little different, and experiencing items, monsters, and others, which have been part of this pack, but never seen before. Fear them, they are spoopy and some fun! ....some. </li>
    <li> Removed modifications that are no longer required. </li>
    <li> Updated all mopdifications to their latest and working versions. </li>
    <li> Removed all dependencies of modifications to clean up the manifest, and remove depricated dependencies from being auto pulled or installed in the pack when they are no longer needed. (Dependencies are auto-pulled by download/update of base mods)</li>
    <li> Overall modpack rework. </li>
</ul>

### Removed mods [MA]

        Pooble-LCBetterSaves
                LCBetterSaves, is an unused modification, which is no longer required for this modpack. This can itself be installed clientside, due to not being reliant for the host to have it installed.
        Piggy-ShowCapacity
                ShowCapacity, is an unused modification, which is no longer required for this modpack. This mod itself is no longer needed due to an already in-use modification adding this funtionality to it, deeming this no longer required.
        NutNutty-SellTracker
                SellTracker, is an unused modification, which is no longer required for this modpack. This mod was never really used as such, and deemed to be an addition to the culling of mods.
        NotAtomicBomb-Terminal_Clock
                Terminal_Clock, is an unused modification, which is no longer required for this modpack. This mod is no longer required due to the functionality being part of another modification.
        Monkeytype-HideChat
                HideChat, is an unused modification, which is no longer required for this modpack. This mod never really worked, and another modpack that is in-use, provides the same functionality for this option also.
        LethalAPI-LethalAPI_Terminal
                LethalAPI_Terminal, is an unused modification, which is no longer required for this modpack. This mod/dependancy is no longer required due to being a dependency for "Terminal_Clock", thus is also up for the choppping block.
        Bobbie-UniTask
                UniTask, is an unused modification, which is no longer required for this modpack. An additional modpack that is no longer used or required, and will be escorted to the firing wall like the others.
        RosiePies-Gordion_Sect0-2.3.1
                Gordion_Sect0, is no longer required due to it featured content as part of the developers "Gordion Saga" pack.
        RosiePies-Sector0_Interior-2.1.2
                Sector0_Interior, is no longer required due to it featured content as part of the developers "Gordion Saga" pack.
        DiFFoZ-CompanyCruiserFix
                CompanyCruiserFix, is no longer working and required due to it being marked as depricated.
        Zaggy1024-PathfindingLagFix
                PathfindingLagFix, removal due to no longer requiring this change and being depricated.
        SylviBlossom-TerminalConflictFix
                TerminalConflictFix, no longer required due to this being a belated issue which is no longer impacting the modpack and gameplay.
        RosiePies-RoseLib
                RoseLib, library that is no longer required, or requested as a dependency from the primary focused mods we have selected for the pack.
        All Dependencies.
                Only the mods we are of interest in have been included, and all dependencies are left out, due to them already being auto pulled with the pack when downloaded/updated. To help clear through the clutter, and elimiate manually removing depricated mods that are no longer listed as a dependency for it's previously primary base mod that used it, and then left to rot in the pack....

### Added mods [MA]

                OpenLib, is an Open-source development library for LethalCompany, initially created for use with darmuh's Mods.

### Config changes [MI]

        Config changes have been vastly changed, including LethalLevelLoader, which i have personally introduced a full item dictionary, with customised prices, spawning percentages, and a more refined method for the correct themed items and dungeons that are related to the theme of the moon. This is to keep the flow of the theme and environment to a similar track than dealing with the Egypt custom moon, having a office interior, rather than the actual pyramids dungeon... That was just silly...

### Updated mods [PA]

        All dependencies have been removed from the packs manifest, and reworked completely, so that any of said dependencies are pulled down with the specified mod that we want. This was a great suggestion by the BadDragon (Phyore), who rightly pointed out that it elimiates any depricated mods from the pack when i update it in the future. Saving time, effort, and my spicy-ass brain from forgetting to remove the depricated mod, which also leads to bugs, breaks, and overall desync.

### Removed mods [MA]

        Alice-ScarletDevilMansion-1.3.27
                Due to an impact of performance for lower end rigs, i've opted to remove it until it's more compatible with the mod-pack and running on lower spec rigs overall.
        DaXcess-LethalCompanyVR-1.3.2
                Bugged and caused major crashing. Due to it never being unused by the members who play in the sessions, removal was of best interest and those who want to play with VR capabilities can do so by adding it themselves due to it being a client-side mod anyway.

                Bugged and created a spam within the console and logs, removing temporarily until this is resolved by the dev.

                Never utilised to its fullest potential and was removed.
        ViViKo-NoSellLimit-1.0.1
                Bugged and never worked in the first place.
        WhiteSpike-Peeper-1.0.3
                Went unused and removed.
        WhiteSpike-Portable_Teleporters-1.0.3
                Bugged and also went unused.
