# Hidden's Lethal Company mod-pack

## _For the fuzzy company_

This mod-pack is built around a large collection of fuzzy crew-mates, with many additions to chaos via plenty of fine tuning.
The pack consists of QoL mods, Exploration mods, Additional content for extended playtime, and overall chaotic modifications so that it's never an easy shift.
Navigation has also been set as blind and random, so you'll never know what you get moon, weather, or dungeon.
